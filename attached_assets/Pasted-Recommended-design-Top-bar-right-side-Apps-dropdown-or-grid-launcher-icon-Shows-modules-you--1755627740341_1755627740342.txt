Recommended design
Top bar (right side): “Apps” dropdown (or grid launcher icon).
Shows modules you’re allowed to access with short labels + icons.
Groups modules under pillars to reduce clutter.

New Visitor Assimilation (pipeline, follow‑ups)
Groups Analytics
Assessment
Spiritual Gifts (questions, versions, results)
Serve Central
Opportunities (CRUD, approvals)
Applications (review/assign)
Events
Church‑wide Calendar
Event Requests/Approvals
Facilities & Recurring Schedules
Giving & Finance (only FINANCE_ADMIN / CHURCH_SUPER_ADMIN)
Giving Dashboard
Budgets & Approvals
Admin
Users & Roles
Theme & Branding
Feature Flags / Modules
Integrations (Zoom/Meet/Teams)
Show a tiny badge for pending approvals (e.g., Events • 3, Serve • 2).
Permission logic (who sees what)
CHURCH_SUPER_ADMIN: sees all church modules.
PASTORAL_STAFF: Community, Growth, Events, Prayer, limited Admin (roles in their ministry).
MINISTRY_LEADER: Groups they own, Serve Central (their ministry), Event requests, Prayer moderation for their groups.
ASSIMILATION_DIRECTOR/MEMBER: Growth (pipeline) only.
FINANCE_ADMIN: Finance & facilities approvals + Events (budget/facility approvals).
VOLUNTEER/CHURCH_MEMBER: no admin app‑switcher.
Navigation details
Global search (⌘K / Ctrl+K): jump to any module, person, group, event.
Breadcrumbs inside each module: e.g., Events ▸ Approvals ▸ “Youth Night”.
Quick actions row under the dropdown (“+ Event”, “+ Opportunity”) shown if permitted.
Responsive: on mobile, the app switcher opens a full‑screen sheet.
Consistent with member UI: bottom nav for members remains; admins get top app‑switcher when in admin views.
Implementation sketch
Table: modules (id, name, pillar, icon, feature_flag)
Map roles→permissions in code or role_permissions table.
Build menu items from: enabled modules ∩ user’s permissions.
Feature flags let you hide unfinished areas without deploys.
Deep links: each item routes to /admin/{module}; preserve last subpage per user.
Approvals surfacing
Include notification dots in the app switcher and a unified “Approvals” view aggregating:
Event promotions (Leader → Admin)
Group creation requests (Member → Leader/Admin)
Serve applications (Member → Leader)
Prayer reports (for moderators)
Budget/facility requests
Polishing touches
Icons: use a steady set (e.g., lucide-react).
Descriptions in the dropdown: one line under each app.
Recent section: last 3 admin pages visited.
Acceptance checklist
App switcher shows only modules the user can access.
Badges reflect pending approvals user can act on.
Global search jumps across modules with permissions enforced.
Feature flags can hide any module church‑by‑church.
Works great on mobile (sheet), desktop (dropdown grid), and keyboard (⌘K).
