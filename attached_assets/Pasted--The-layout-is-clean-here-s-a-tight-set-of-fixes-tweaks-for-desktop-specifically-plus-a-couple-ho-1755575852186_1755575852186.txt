The layout is clean! here’s a tight set of fixes/tweaks for desktop specifically, plus a couple honesty/copy updates so it matches what’s live in Phase 1.

Quick wins (desktop UI)

* Tabs: use sentence case everywhere → “Sign in” / “Sign up”. Make the active tab visually stronger (bold label + slightly darker pill).
* Form card: increase contrast on labels (aim for WCAG 4.5:1), and add:
  * “Show password” toggle
  * “Forgot password?” link under the password field
  * Inline error text (e.g., “Please enter a valid email”)
* Primary button: same brand purple as your site, width 100% of card, min-height 48–52px.
* Microcopy under button: “Secure sign in • By continuing, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.”
* Keyboard/Accessibility: associate <label for> with inputs, autocomplete="email" and autocomplete="current-password", visible focus ring.

Right panel (desktop hero) — accuracy + clarity

Your three bullets currently promise features that aren’t live yet (e.g., “Church communication platform”). Swap to what’s true in Phase 1:

Headline: The Operating System for Your Church
Subhead: Equip your church with tools for communication, organization, and discipleship.

Bullets (desktop):

* Spiritual gifts assessment & ministry matching
* Member management (beta)
* Administrative dashboard (basic analytics)
* Professional church subdomain (yourchurch.kingdomops.app)

Tip: keep to 3–4 bullets total; each ~3–5 words + a small descriptor if needed.

Copy polish (ready to paste)

* Under logo: “Access your church management and spiritual gifts platform.”
* Card header: “Welcome back”
Subtext: “Sign in to access your church dashboard and assessments.”
* Right-panel headline alternative (stronger): “Discover Your Gifts & Purpose”
Subhead: “Take the spiritual gifts assessment and equip your members to serve where they thrive.”

Visual tweaks (desktop)

* Balance the split: reduce left-side white space by ~8–12% or increase the form card width slightly so the left feels anchored.
* Icon alignment: center the crown icon vertically with the right-panel headline; increase top padding so the hero breathes.
* Shadow/Depth: give the form card a soft shadow (e.g., Tailwind shadow-xl/5) and rounded-2xl to match the rest of the brand.

Optional enhancements (if supported)

* Remember me checkbox.
* Back to Home link in the top-right (mirrors your Inner Circle page).

Acceptance criteria (dev-ready)

* Active tab uses brand purple background, white text, bold label.
* Email field has type="email" autocomplete="email", password has autocomplete="current-password".
* “Forgot password?” link routes to reset flow; error messages appear inline and set aria-invalid="true".
* Right-panel bullets updated to Phase-1 features (no comms platform claim).
* Button height ≥48px; tab and button hit areas ≥44px vertically.
