This new screenshot already looks much closer to a modern SaaS feel 👌 — that gradient header and dropdown apps menu are moving in the right direction. Here are a few ways to make this header + apps switcher even more modern and differentiated:
🔹 Header Improvements
Visual Hierarchy
Keep the gradient, but give the apps menu its own distinct style — maybe a pill-shaped button with icon + label (similar to Notion / Linear).
Separate profile & notifications on the far right with a subtle divider line or lighter background badge.
Search Bar
Add a global search bar (centered or left-aligned). This makes the system feel powerful and reduces “click hunting.”
Example: 🔍 Search churches, users, events…
Quick Actions
Next to “Apps,” consider a + Create button (dropdown) for quick actions like:
Add Event
Add Member
Add Opportunity
Keeps admins from diving deep into menus for common tasks.
🔹 Apps Dropdown Modernization
Right now it feels a little dense. A couple refinements:
Group by Category (with subtle labels and spacing):
Insights → Spiritual Gifts, Assessments, Analytics
Management → Churches, System Admin
Engagement → Serve Central, Events, Messaging
Use Icons + Short Descriptions
Each app should have a distinct icon (line-style, minimal).
Beneath the title, a 2–3 word subtext makes it scannable (e.g., Track gifts, Run analytics, Manage events).
Recent / Frequent Apps Section
Top of dropdown shows 2–3 most used apps with timestamp (like your screenshot hints at).
The rest of the apps fall into grouped categories.
🔹 Dashboard Alignment
Looking at the cards:
They’re clean, but could pop more with tiny sparkline charts (showing growth trend instead of just a number).
Consider a 2-column layout instead of 3 small cards + 2 big ones — makes it less blocky.
Example:
| Total Churches   | Active Users | Global Assessments |
| Assessments Done | Pending      | Ministry Matches   |
✅ Inspiration Sources to Check Out:
Linear (for dropdown / quick actions style)
Notion (for app switcher simplicity)
Stripe Dashboard (for super clean stat cards with sparklines)
