adding Prayer as its own tab alongside Feed / Groups / Serve could make the prayer experience much stronger. Right now prayer requests are “just posts,” but with a Prayer tab you’d be elevating it into a dedicated spiritual rhythm, not just another post type.
✝️ How It Would Work
1. Tabs: Feed | Groups | Serve | Prayer
Feed → general posts (testimonies, announcements, highlights).
Groups → sub-community spaces (young adults, men’s, women’s, etc.).
Serve → ministry opportunities (Serve Central hub).
Prayer → prayer wall, where all prayer posts are collected.
2. Posting Flow
When someone posts a prayer request in the Feed:
It shows in the Feed like normal (so the whole community can engage).
It’s automatically filtered into the Prayer tab, creating a permanent, scrollable Prayer Wall.
3. Prayer Wall Features
List of all current prayer requests (latest first).
Prayed button 🙏 → increments a counter (“23 people prayed”).
Filter options → by ministry, group, or “urgent.”
Answered prayers → request can be marked as answered, moving to an “Answered” section (celebration feed 🎉).
Notifications → if you post a prayer, you get notified when someone prays for it.
4. Benefits of Adding Prayer Tab
✅ Spiritual centrality → reminds members that prayer is core, not just a side feature.
✅ Encourages engagement → people who may not post testimonies or serve yet can still participate by clicking “I prayed.”
✅ Creates momentum → seeing 50+ people prayed motivates others to add requests.
✅ Historical encouragement → answered prayers archive becomes a testimony bank.
💡 Big Picture
The top nav would then look like this:
Feed | Groups | Serve | Prayer
Feed = the heartbeat (daily activity).
Groups = belonging (specific communities).
Serve = action (step into opportunities).
Prayer = spiritual engine (intercession + celebration).
👉 I think adding Prayer as a top-level tab is a powerful move — it makes KingdomOps more than just a management tool, it makes it a true discipleship + spiritual community platform.
