Great question. Make the Health Score a single 0–100 number that reflects engagement in the last N days (default 30), computed on the server so it’s consistent and fast.

Here’s a practical, defendable formula you can ship now.

---

1) Inputs (for a time window range, default 30d)

Per church/org:

* totalMembers
* activeUsers (distinct users with a session/action in range)
* Communication counts: posts, prayers, announcements, mediaUploads
* Ministry: assessmentsCompleted, eligibleForAssessment (usually = members)
* Structure/discipleship: newGroups (created in range)
* Mission: eventsCreated (in range)
* Serving: ministryMatches (members placed into a team/role in range)

Derived:

* per100 = max(1, totalMembers/100) (so small churches aren’t punished)
* commPer100 = (posts + prayers + announcements) / per100

---

2) Targets & normalizers (for 30 days)

Choose caps/targets so “good” performance lands near 1.0 and we clamp at 1.0.

Metric	Normalization (0…1)	30-day Target (T)
A – Active ratio	A = clamp(activeUsers / totalMembers)	(implicit)
C – Communication	C = clamp(commPer100 / 20)	20 posts/prayers/announcements per 100 members
S – Assessments	S = clamp(assessmentsCompleted / eligibleForAssessment)	100% over time
G – New groups	G = clamp(newGroups / 2)	2 per month
E – Events	E = clamp(eventsCreated / 4)	4 per month
M – Ministry matches	M = clamp(ministryMatches / (0.03 * totalMembers))	3% of members / month


clamp(x) = min(1, max(0, x))

Adjust targets to your culture later (e.g., change events target to 2/month or matches to 5%/mo). The normalization keeps the score robust across church sizes.

---

3) Weights (sum to 1)

Start with engagement-heavy weights:

* wA = 0.35 (Active users)
* wC = 0.25 (Communication)
* wS = 0.15 (Assessments completion)
* wG = 0.10 (New groups)
* wE = 0.07 (Events)
* wM = 0.08 (Ministry matches)

---

4) Final score

score0_1 = wA*A + wC*C + wS*S + wG*G + wE*E + wM*M
HealthScore = round(100 * score0_1)


Add labels:

* ≥ 85: Excellent
* 70–84: Healthy
* 55–69: Watch
* < 55: At Risk

Show a tooltip:
“Active 35%, Comms 25%, Assessments 15%, Groups 10%, Events 7%, Matches 8%. 30-day window.”

---

5) Guardrails & fairness

* Small churches: use per100 = max(1, members/100) so rates don’t explode for <100 members.
* Provisional flag: if totalMembers < 20 or range < 14d, show “Provisional score”.
* Smoothing: optionally average the last 2 periods (EMA) to reduce volatility.
* Time range aware: recompute targets for 90d/12m by multiplying targets (e.g., events target = 4 * monthsInRange).

---

6) Example (30d)

* Members 120, Active 48 → A = 48/120 = 0.40
* Posts 20 + Prayers 12 + Announcements 3 = 35 → commPer100 = 35 / 1.2 = 29.17
C = clamp(29.17 / 20) = 1.00
* Assessments 72/120 → S = 0.60
* New groups 3 → G = clamp(3/2) = 1.00
* Events 4 → E = clamp(4/4) = 1.00
* Matches 15; target 0.03*120 = 3.6 → M = clamp(15/3.6) = 1.00

Score:

= 0.35*0.40 + 0.25*1 + 0.15*0.60 + 0.10*1 + 0.07*1 + 0.08*1
= 0.14 + 0.25 + 0.09 + 0.10 + 0.07 + 0.08
= 0.73 → 73/100 (Healthy)

7) Server implementation sketch (pseudo)

// GET /api/admin/churches/:id/dashboard?range=30d
const R = parseRange(query.range ?? '30d'); // start,end
const m = await metricsForOrg(orgId, R);    // gather counts, distincts, etc.

const per100 = Math.max(1, m.totalMembers / 100);
const A = clamp(m.activeUsers / Math.max(1, m.totalMembers));
const C = clamp(((m.posts + m.prayers + m.announcements) / per100) / 20);
const S = clamp(m.assessmentsCompleted / Math.max(1, m.eligibleForAssessment));
const G = clamp(m.newGroups / (2 * R.months));            // scale targets by months in range
const E = clamp(m.eventsCreated / (4 * R.months));
const M = clamp(m.ministryMatches / (0.03 * m.totalMembers * R.months));

const score = 100 * (0.35*A + 0.25*C + 0.15*S + 0.10*G + 0.07*E + 0.08*M);

return {
  healthScore: Math.round(score),
  band: band(score),
  explain: { A, C, S, G, E, M, weights: {A:0.35, C:0.25, S:0.15, G:0.10, E:0.07, M:0.08} }
};

8) Make it actionable (UI nudges)

Alongside the score, show 1–2 tips based on the lowest normalized component:

* Low A → “Only 18% active this month. Try a church-wide post and 2 leader invites.”
* Low C → “Post cadence below target. Aim for ≈20 communications per 100 members / month.”
* Low S → “Assessment completion at 32%. Prompt members during service.”
* Low M → “Few people placed on teams. Create opportunities or run a serve push.”

If you want, I can tune the targets/weights to your actual dataset once you have a few churches live—just export a month of anonymized metrics and we’ll calibrate so 70 ≈ “typical” and 85+ truly stands out.
