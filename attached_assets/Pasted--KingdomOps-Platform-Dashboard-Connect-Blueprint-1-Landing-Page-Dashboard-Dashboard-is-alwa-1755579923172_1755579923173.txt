📋 KingdomOps Platform – Dashboard + Connect Blueprint
1. Landing Page = Dashboard
Dashboard is always the login landing page.
Purpose: show personal next steps in discipleship.
Dashboard Sections (card layout):
Greeting Banner – personalized (“Good morning, Travis!”).
Spiritual Gifts Assessment CTA
If no results → big “Take Assessment” card.
If completed → show “Your Top Gifts” with “Find Where to Serve.”
Perfect Matches for You – serving opportunities that align with gifts (from Serve Central).
Generosity Card – last gift, quick “Give Now,” recurring giving.
Upcoming Events – next 2–3 events with RSVP buttons.
KingdomOps Connect Teaser – show 2–3 latest community posts; “View All” opens Connect.
2. Connect (Community Module)
Connect is a full social feed, not just a dashboard card.
Accessible via bottom nav + side drawer as “Connect.”
Features in Connect:
Feed (Facebook-style): posts, testimonies, prayer requests, announcements, serve opportunities, events.
Post Types:
Testimony ✍️
Prayer 🙏 (with “I prayed” reaction)
Announcement 📣
Event 📅 (with RSVP/Register)
Serve Opportunity 🙋 (from Serve Central)
Groups – ministries/small groups have their own feeds + events.
Engagement – like, comment, share, report.
Events Integration – group events + church-wide events show in feed.
Serve Central Integration – recommended roles surface inside feed.
Notifications – mentions, replies, event reminders, serve applications.
3. Serve Central (Volunteer Hub)
Dedicated tab for all ministry opportunities.
Looks like a marketplace board (listings with role, description, required gifts, apply button).
Matches to Gifts appear on Dashboard and in Connect.
4. Events
Full events tab + integration into Dashboard and Connect.
Event page includes:
Details (time, place, RSVP/Register)
Attendees list + comments
“Join Meeting” button if virtual (meeting link).
5. Gifts (Assessment & Results)
Tab with:
Take Assessment
View Results (top gifts, scriptures)
Recommended serving matches.
Dashboard surfaces the CTA or results summary.
Connect occasionally reminds members (“🎉 You completed your gifts assessment! See serving matches.”).
6. Giving
Tab for generosity/giving history.
Quick card on Dashboard for last gift + Give Now button.
7. Roles & Permissions (simplified)
Member: post, comment, prayer requests, RSVP, apply to serve.
Volunteer: same as member + see team schedule (future).
Ministry Leader: manage group, post serve opportunities, create group events.
Pastoral Staff: post church-wide announcements, moderate.
Finance Admin: manage giving/budgets (outside Connect).
Church Super Admin: full church control.
Super Admin: platform owner.
8. Navigation
Bottom nav: Home · Events · Serve · Gifts · Give
Side drawer: adds Connect, Profile, Settings.
“+” Button (top or FAB): opens role-based create menu (post, prayer, event, serve opportunity).
Bottom nav auto-hides when scrolling down; reappears when scrolling up.
✅ Acceptance Criteria
On login → Dashboard loads (not Connect).
Dashboard cards show correctly based on user state (assessment taken/not taken).
“View All” on Connect card → opens full Connect feed.
Members can post prayer/testimony in Connect.
Leaders can post opportunities/events.
Serve Central matches show in Dashboard + Connect.
Giving, Gifts, Events all accessible via tabs.
Role permissions respected (members can’t access finance, etc.).
👉 This keeps things simple but comprehensive. The screenshot you shared already shows the Dashboard layout. This blueprint just locks down the rules + flows so the AI agent knows:
Dashboard = home
Connect = full community module
Serve, Gifts, Events, Give = standalone tabs feeding into Dashboard/Connect.
