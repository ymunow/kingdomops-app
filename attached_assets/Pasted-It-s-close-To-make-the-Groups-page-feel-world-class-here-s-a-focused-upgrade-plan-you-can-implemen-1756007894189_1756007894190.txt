It’s close! To make the Groups page feel world-class, here’s a focused upgrade plan you can implement without rethinking the whole screen.
High-impact UI upgrades
Two clear sections:
My Groups (grid, 2–3 columns) with quick actions.
Discover Groups (smart recommendations + filters).
Richer group cards (for both sections):
Cover image or color + privacy badge (public/private)
Next meeting pill (e.g., “Wed • 7:00p • Main Campus” or “Online”)
Activity meter (use the purple bar to indicate weekly post count/unread)
Member avatars (+ count), roles (Leader), capacity (e.g., 12/15)
Quick actions: Open Feed, Message Leaders, RSVP, Favorite ★, Bell 🔔
State-aware CTA: Join, Request to Join, Pending, Leave
Hover/Quick view: on card hover (or tap), show a 1-screen preview: description, last 3 posts, leaders, and a Join CTA.
Discoverability (filters + ranking)
Filter bar above Discover:
Search, Category (Bible Study/Prayer/Youth/Men/Women/Outreach), Day, Time, Format (In-person/Online/Hybrid), Campus/Location, Childcare, Language, Accessibility.
Sort: Recommended, Most Active, Newest, Next Meeting Soon.
Recommendations row (first carousel): “Because of your gifts (Teaching)”, “Near your campus”, “Meets on nights you’re free”.
Empty/edge states:
No groups found → show 3 suggested alternatives and a Request a Group button.
New member → show 3 starter groups with soft join (no long forms).
Leader & member flows
Leader quick actions (on their groups): Manage Members, Create Event, Post Announcement.
Invite links & QR from each card.
Favorites tab for users who browse a lot before joining.
Microcopy polish
“Open Group Feed” → Open Feed
“18 members • Active feed” → 18 members • Active this week
Add tooltips to privacy badges (Public = anyone can join, Private = request required).
Tech notes (easy wins)
Use the existing gradient bar as activity/next-meeting progress instead of decoration.
Card layout: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-4, min card height ~140.
Show unread count badge on cards the user belongs to.
Preload cover images with loading="lazy" and decoding="async".
Ensure buttons are consistent width (min-w-[140px]) and 44px tall for a11y.
