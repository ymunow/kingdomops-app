Right now the design is functional (clean and clear), but it can feel a bit flat. Here’s how we can make it visually engaging:
🎨 1. Visual Styling
Use ministry imagery/icons → Each role card should have a small icon or thumbnail image (e.g., 🎤 for Worship Sound Tech, 🧒 for Children’s Ministry).
Card backgrounds with accent colors → Instead of all-white, use light tints by ministry (e.g., light blue for Worship, light yellow for Kids).
Urgent tags → make “Urgent” red pill-shaped badge with a pulse effect (subtle animation).
🌟 2. Highlight Matches
Progress-style match bar → Instead of just “92% match,” show a green progress bar for visual emphasis.
Gift icons → show which gifts match (e.g., Teaching, Helps) with little gift-tag icons next to the % match.
🖼️ 3. Photography / Illustration
Add small ministry photos or illustrations in each card (happy kids, worship team, tech booth).
Even subtle images make the opportunities feel alive and relatable.
🙌 4. Call-to-Action Buttons
Make “Apply to Serve” buttons bold and inviting:
Full-width with gradient (e.g., purple → gold).
Add an icon: 🙋 or ✅.
Change hover state: button grows slightly + shadow.
🪄 5. Extra Engagement Touches
“Why serve?” banner at top of Serve Central with a short encouragement verse (e.g., “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others.” – 1 Peter 4:10).
Testimonials: rotate a small carousel at the top (“Serving in Worship has helped me grow in faith!” – Sarah J.).
Filter chips → quick filters for “Kids,” “Worship,” “Hospitality,” etc. (makes browsing easier).
