you’ve already aligned the dashboards to the four main personas in KingdomOps. Each of them has different “jobs to be done,” so the dashboards should feel tailored to those jobs instead of just showing the same stats with different access.
Here’s how I’d refine each one, including what widgets belong where and how the visual style can distinguish them:
🔹 1. Super Admin Dashboard (You / Software Developer)
Audience: Platform owner/operator (multi-church view, system oversight).
Goal: Monitor platform health, growth, and usage across all churches.
Widgets:
Total churches onboarded (+ growth %)
Total members across platform
Active users (last 30 days)
Assessments (started vs completed globally)
Approvals overview (pending items across churches)
System alerts (integration errors, feature flags, license usage)
Recent activity feed (latest logins/events/approvals)
Visual Style:
“Control Center” vibe → dark accent header bar with a glowing Apps Switcher button.
Make it feel meta-level above all churches.
🔹 2. Church Admin Dashboard (Church Operations Staff)
Audience: Local church admins (staff responsible for people + processes).
Goal: Manage congregation growth, events, and volunteer pipeline.
Widgets:
Member growth chart (month-to-month)
Pending assessments / % completed
Volunteer opportunities (filled vs unfilled)
Group health snapshot (active groups, new groups pending approval)
Event approvals (services, rehearsals, special events)
Giving overview (if offering module is live)
Visual Style:
Warm, community-driven colors (lighter gradients).
Church branding icon (uploadable logo) in header for ownership feel.
🔹 3. Church Leader Dashboard (Ministry Leaders, Group Leaders, Team Captains)
Audience: Ministry/team leaders managing a portion of the church.
Goal: Track their group/team’s growth, engagement, and needs.
Widgets:
My Team Members (with engagement/attendance quick view)
Upcoming events & rehearsals (recurring event support)
Serve requests pending approval (if they’re approvers)
Attendance check-ins (who’s missing, who’s new)
Direct messages or announcements for their group
Visual Style:
Minimal, task-focused dashboard (don’t overload them).
Emphasis on “My Team” / “My Events” to keep them in their lane.
🔹 4. Member Dashboard (Regular Church Member)
Audience: Everyday church members.
Goal: Stay engaged spiritually + socially with the church.
Widgets:
My Gifts (with matches to ministry opportunities)
My Groups (with quick access to discussions & events)
Upcoming events I’m attending
Serve opportunities I can apply for
My Giving (history + quick give option)
Personal growth tracker (assessments completed, streaks, etc.)
Visual Style:
Friendly, approachable, mobile-first.
Feels less like “software,” more like a community hub.
✨ Big Picture:
Super Admin = Control Tower (system-wide health & oversight)
Church Admin = Church Operations (local growth & processes)
Leader = My Team & My Events (simplified, action-driven)
Member = My Journey & My Community (engagement + discipleship)
